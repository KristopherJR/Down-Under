// --------------- VERSION NOTES --------------- //

Initial version of the project. At this stage, the project has been set-up using a YouTube guide found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk

This version sees the implementation of basic collision physics. There is a player token with a static asset, it is not animated yet.

A floor tile map has also been added and the player spawns, and falls onto it. The player can press WASD, The arrow keys or use a gamepad to move the player token.

If the player walks off the edge, they fall off the map as gravity has also been implemented.

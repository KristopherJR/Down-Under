<h1>Objective</h1>
The objective of Down Under is to enter the cave and gather as many coins and gems as you possibly can. The cave is full with toxic gas, meaning your Oxygen supply is limited and you'll have to work fast to claim your riches and get out alive! Beware, there are also enemies down there which don't take kindly to trespassers in their home.

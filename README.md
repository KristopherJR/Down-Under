# Down Under
Down Under is a 2D side-scrolling platformer game made by the team "The Boomers and The Zoomer" for COMP2411. The game will be developed using the GoDot game engine, utilizing the built-in GDScript. The game is compatible with keyboard, mouse and controller and as of version: 0.3.6 is ready for submission as our group protoype. All of the initial "Must-Have" requirements have been met, and some of the "Should-Have" requirements have also been met.

<h1>Objective</h1>
The objective of Down Under is to enter the cave and gather as many coins and gems as you possibly can. The cave is full with toxic gas, meaning your Oxygen supply is limited and you'll have to work fast to claim your riches and get out alive! Beware, there are also enemies down there which don't take kindly to trespassers in their home.
